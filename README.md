# Morse-Code-Trainer
###(CES Lab project)

##Task:
To connect a PC keyboard and a beeper to an Arduino. Develop a morse code trainer that will play corresponding Morse code sounds when one of the keys A-Z is pressed.

##General Idea:
1)	When arduino is active it will give a well come sound e.g, “Hello”
2)	After pressing “Enter” key arduino will be transferred signal to the beeper
3)	There will be a unique sound for every key (A-Z)
4)	There will be a unique sound for the unique word
5)	There will be a unique sound for the unique sentences as well
6)	“Page Up” and “Page Down” keys to select the letter, word and sentence mode
7)	“Shift” key will be define the upper and lower case
8)	A error tone will be given pressing the invalid keys

##Tools:
1)	1 PS/2 Keyboard
2)	1 Arduino UNO
3)	1 Beeper
4)	1 Power supply (5V)
5)	Connecting wires
